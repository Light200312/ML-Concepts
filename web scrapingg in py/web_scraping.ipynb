    "When you hit a \"wall of protection\" (like Cloudflare, Akamai, or DataDome), standard libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` fail because they don't behave like a real human browser. They lack headers, cookies, and the ability to execute JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the four most effective ways to bypass bot protection:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Use a \"Stealth\" Browser (Playwright or Selenium)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern protection checks if the browser can run JavaScript. Standard scrapers can't, so they get blocked instantly.\n",
    "**Playwright with the Stealth plugin** is the gold standard right now. It mimics human behavior like mouse movements and screen resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Install: pip install playwright playwright-stealth\n",
    "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n",
    "from playwright_stealth import stealth_sync\n",
    "\n",
    "with sync_playwright() as p:\n",
    "    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)\n",
    "    page = browser.new_page()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This line makes the bot look like a real user\n",
    "    stealth_sync(page)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    page.goto(\"https://blocked-site.com\")\n",
    "    print(page.title())\n",
    "    browser.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Rotate Your User-Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A User-Agent tells the server what browser and OS you are using. If you send 500 requests with the default \"python-requests/2.28\" header, you will be banned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fix:** Use a real browser string and rotate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "headers = {\n",
    "    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'\n",
    "}\n",
    "response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Use `cloudscraper` (For Cloudflare only)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloudflare is the most common protection (the \"Just a moment...\" screen). A library called `cloudscraper` is designed specifically to solve these challenges automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Install: pip install cloudscraper\n",
    "import cloudscraper\n",
    "\n",
    "scraper = cloudscraper.create_scraper() # Returns a requests-like object\n",
    "print(scraper.get(\"https://website-with-cloudflare.com\").text)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Use Residential Proxies\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make too many requests from one IP, that IP gets \"blacklisted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datacenter IPs:** Cheap, but easily detected (AWS, Google Cloud IPs).\n",
    "* **Residential IPs:** These look like they come from a home Wi-Fi (Verizon, Comcast). They are much harder for websites to block.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level of Protection | Recommended Tool |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Low** (Checks headers) | `requests` + Real User-Agent |\n",
    "| **Medium** (Cloudflare/JS Check) | `cloudscraper` or `Playwright` |\n",
    "| **High** (Behavioral Analysis) | `Playwright Stealth` + Residential Proxies |\n",
    "| **Extreme** (CAPTCHAs) | 2Capcha / Anti-Captcha API Services |\n",
    "\n",
    "### A \"Fair Warning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping behind protection often violates a site's **Terms of Service**. Always check `robots.txt` (e.g., `example.com/robots.txt`) to see what the site allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which site is giving you trouble? If I know the specific site, I can tell you exactly which \"wall\" they are using."
